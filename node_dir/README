1. Initialise the NPM
    npm init -y
    - to setup npm in that directory
2. Install the Express Package
    npm i express
3. Write server application in index.js
4. To load an ES module, we have to include "type": "module" in the package.json.
5. Start server
    node index.js
        - make sure you end the server first

### We are using ES Modules not CommonJS modules

Tools to use to help you code in node:
Nodemon [https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon](Nodemon)
- automatically restars the node applicaiton when file changes in the directory are detected 
    npm install -g nodemon # or using yarn: yarn global add nodemon
    Then run index.js using nodemon
        nodemon index.js

To launch an HTML file using Express, you need to use the res.sendFile method, which sends a file to the browser. You also need to specify the path to the file, which can be done using the path module. For example, if your join.html file is in the same folder as your contact.js file, you can write:

import express from "express";
import path from "path";
export const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "join.html"));
});

This will send the join.html file when the user requests the / route. You can also use other routes to send different HTML files, or use parameters to dynamically send files based on the request. For more information on how to use res.sendFile, you can check out this web page.
