                        The Student Team for Alberta Rocketry Research (STARR) is a team of like-minded students 
                        from an array of disciplines and faculties who have come together with the common goal of 
                        expanding Albertaâ€™s space industry through the development, testing, and launching of high 
                        altitude sounding rockets.
