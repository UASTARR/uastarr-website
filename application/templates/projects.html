                        Ringo I was the University of Alberta's first sounding rocket that competed in the inaugural 2022 Launch Canada Challenge. 
                        The launch vehicle employed a dual event recovery system and was propelled to 10,671 ft on August 2, 2022. 
                        Members of STARR worked and designed the rocket throughout the 2021-2022 academic year and was awarded first place in the 
                        Payload Design Challenge and top 5 in the Basic Launch Challenge. Ringo I went on to launch successfully, becoming the second 
                        ever amateur experimental rocket launch on Canadian soil.
